# Movie-Recommender-System

This recommender system was made as a part of course curriculum of My University.

It contains a [Movie Recommender System made Using KNearest Neighbours](https://github.com/absterjr/Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/movie-recommendation.ipynb).

The [API](https://github.com/absterjr/Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/API/main.py) used was Fastapi and the FrontEnd was made using [HTML](https://github.com/absterjr/Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/templates2/form2.html).
The front end made for this project is the most basic one.
